If you have installed MelonLoader, you can now install mods and plugins for Schedule I.

## Important Notes
**Always back up** your game files as well as your save files before installing mods or plugins. Mods can sometimes cause issues, and having a backup will allow you to restore your game to its original state if needed.

**Check mod compatibility** with the version of Schedule I you are using. Some mods may not work with the latest game updates or may require specific versions of MelonLoader.

**Beware of malicious mods.** Download mods from trusted sources. If you're unsure about the mod's safety, check the comments or reviews on the mod page, or ask in the community Discord server. There's also a scanner, developed by Bars available at [MLVScan](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/ifBars/MLVScan/) that can help catch some suspicious mods. However, it is not a guarantee that the mod is safe, so always be cautious.

# Automatic Installation
Use a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) for Thunderstore mods, or [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1) for NexusMods mods. These mod managers will automatically handle the installation of MelonLoader and mods for you.

# Manual Installation
If you prefer to install mods manually, follow the steps below.

## Installing Mods
Check if the mod you want to install is compatible with your game branch. Many mods are made for the main branch, but some may only work with the alternate branch. If you are unsure, check the mod's description or ask the author. Explaination of the branches can be found in the [Common Terms](/docs/modusers/common_terms/) guide.

Download the mod you want to install. Authors of this guide recommend using [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/) to find mods, although a [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/schedule1/mods) page is also available.

Extract the downloaded mod archive. You should see a `.dll` file or `Mods` folder with a `.dll` file inside. If there are multiple `.dll` files, refer to [Common Terms](/docs/modusers/common_terms/) guide.

Copy the `.dll` file to `Mods` directory in your Schedule I game folder. If the `Mods` directory does not exist, create it.

## Installing Plugins
Plugins are additional features that can enhance the functionality of MelonLoader. They are usually distributed as `.dll` files.

**Plugins are not Mods, and Mods are not Plugins!** Check the mod or plugin description to see if it is a mod or a plugin.

To install a plugin, download the plugin file from sources like the ones mentioned above.

Extract the downloaded plugin archive if necessary. You should see a `.dll` file or a `Plugins` folder with a `.dll` file inside.

Copy the plugin `.dll` file to the `Plugins` directory in your Schedule I game folder. If the `Plugins` directory does not exist, create it.
