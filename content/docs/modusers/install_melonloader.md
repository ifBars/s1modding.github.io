MelonLoader is a mod loader for Unity games, including Schedule I.

Official MelonLoader documentation can be found on the [MelonWiki](https://melonwiki.xyz/). This is a simplified guide to installing MelonLoader for Schedule I.

## Installation Steps

### Automatic Installation

Install a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/ebkr/r2modman/), [Gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/schedule-i/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) for Thunderstore mods or [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1) for NexusMods mods. These mod managers should automatically install MelonLoader for you when you install your first mod or ask you to install it, if they can't do that.

### Manual Installation
#### Windows

##### Installing pre-requisites
Following software is required to run MelonLoader:

[Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable 64 Bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

[.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0 64 Bit](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0#runtime-desktop-6.0.19)

##### Installing MelonLoader
Download [MelonLoader 0.7.0](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.7.0/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) and run it.

## Running Schedule I with MelonLoader
Run the game through Steam as usual. First startup after installing MelonLoader or after updating the game may take a bit longer.

If you have installed MelonLoader correctly, the moment you start the game, a console window should appear. Once the MelonLoader initializes, the game window should open.
