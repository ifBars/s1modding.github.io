# Schedule One Modding Wiki

This project is dedicated to providing resources and documentation for modding Schedule I, a game developed by TVGS. The goal is to create a comprehensive guide for both mod users and mod developers.

## Running the Wiki Locally

To run the wiki locally, you need to have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed. Once you have Hugo set up, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone
cd s1-modding-wiki
hugo server -D
```

This will start a local server, and you can view the wiki at `http://localhost:1313`.
